Voorlopige assumptions

- Tab can nr always open and increasing as there is no max (so indirectly allow plus, plus for inflow)
- (and/or) add turning tab off at any point
- Assume the VC relatioship is (one) bi directional, or Q relation, correspondence for every value
- Behaviour of + and - behaviour in Volume is ambigous, assume one of the three or all?
	- Increase derivative at volume
	- Stable deriative at volume
	- Derease derivative at volume
- maximum value for outflow can have a positive derivative as well, which is considered as "overflow", but does not happen
- Zero cannot have negative derivative assumption

- Verschil tussen state 3 en 16, is 1 state later de kraan dicht doen en ook voor de andere states na 16 is dat ong.
